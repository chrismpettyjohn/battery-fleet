# Overview of the Existing Code
The current Python code has two classes:
- **Battery**: Handles individual battery operations like charging/discharging based on electricity prices.
- **BatteryFleet**: Manages a group of batteries, optimizing their actions based on price and characteristics.

# Expanding the Backend with Python
We're turning this core logic into a backend service using:
- **FastAPI** for the web framework.
- **Kafka** for event streaming.

# Backend Structure
- **API Endpoints**: For battery operations and price retrieval.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time updates.
- **Kafka Integration**: For handling events like price updates and battery state changes.

# Business Logic
- **Core Logic**: Modularized for easier maintenance.
- **Database**: Using PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy for data management.

# Event Streaming
- **Kafka Producers**: Send events like price updates.
- **Kafka Consumers**: Process these events for battery optimization.

# Frontend with Next.js and TypeScript
The frontend includes:
- **Dashboards**: For battery fleet overview and details.
- **Charts and Graphs**: For data visualization.
- **Control Panels**: For manual overrides and maintenance scheduling.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication with the backend.

# Architectural Details
- **Frontend**: Next.js app communicates with backend via APIs and WebSockets.
- **Backend**: FastAPI app with business logic, database interactions, and Kafka events.
- **Database**: Stores all data.
- **Kafka Cluster**: Manages event streams.

# Additional Considerations
- **Security**: Implement authentication, data protection, and secure handling of credentials.
- **Testing**: Use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **CI/CD**: Automate pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions.
