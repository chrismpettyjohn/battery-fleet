Battery Fleet Simulation
This project simulates the operation of a battery fleet interacting with fluctuating energy prices to maximize total revenue. It includes both the simulation logic (api.py) and a simple dashboard (site.py) for monitoring performance via a web interface.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can install it via Homebrew on macOS:

bash
Copy code
brew install python
You also need to clone the repository and set up a virtual environment.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
2. Create a virtual environment
Set up a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies
Use pip to install the required packages listed in requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the application
4.1 Running the Simulation
The api.py file contains the battery fleet simulation logic. You can run it with:

bash
Copy code
python api.py
This will simulate battery operations and output the total revenue and other statistics in the terminal.

4.2 Running the Web Dashboard
To view the dashboard, run the Flask app (site.py) using:

bash
Copy code
python site.py
By default, Flask will serve the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your browser to view the charts and battery statistics.

Usage
The dashboard will display simulated energy prices and the performance of the battery fleet.
You can monitor the charge levels, transactions, and revenue generated by the fleet.
Example
After setting up the environment and running the Flask app, you should see a dashboard similar to the one below:
